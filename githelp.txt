WHEN IN DOUBT
*****
git status



GIT FILE STATES
*****
untracked 
unstaged ("git add" on untracked file, "git add ." adds all files in current directory)
staged 
committed



STARTING UP
*****
git init
git add <filename>
	or 
git add . (does not track file deletion, use git add -A instead)
git status
git commit -m "message" (this is local, will not move to remote repository)
git log



WORKING WITH REMOTE REPOSITORY
*****
git remote add origin <remote repository location> (origin could be anything)
git push origin master (master is the default branch name)
git remote -v (what repositories do you have access to, what are we allowed to do)
git clone <location> (downloads existing remote repository so you can work with it locally)
git push ("commit" to the remote repository)
git pull origin master (updates to latest revision on remote repository)



FORK
*****
Check out a repository, make it your own (like checking out code)




PANIC
*****
git reset --hard HEAD^ (use when working locally and you need to undo commit i.e. erase changes to revision prior, use more of ^ to go further back)
git reset --soft HEAD^ (same as above but does not erase the changes, changes are still staged)


NOTES
*****
> Git doesn't track empty directories
> Git != GitHub. 
	> Git is the tool we use to track changes within a repository, push code.
	> GitHub is a website. It's a place/service we can push our code to.
> Forking is a GitHub thing.
> We push from a local repository to a remote repository and pull the other way.
